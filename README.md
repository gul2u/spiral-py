# Spiral

A Python-based solution submitted to [CodeEval's Spiral Printing Challenge](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/57/).

Final solution was based off an alternating "pop-top" reversal approach as numpy's rotation methods were not supported by CodeEval.

# Usage

Python 2.7.2 was used to execute the code:

```bash
$ python spiral.py [FILENAME]
```
